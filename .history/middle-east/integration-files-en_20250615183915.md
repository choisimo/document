## Arab Spring

### Background and Causes

The Arab Spring, which began around 2010-2011, represented a series of pro-democracy uprisings across the Arab world that led to varied outcomes - from democratic transitions to civil wars.

#### Primary Causes
1. **Economic Crisis** - Following the 2008 global financial crisis
2. **Long-term Economic Deterioration** - Rising food prices made survival difficult, becoming the most direct reason for protest participation
3. **Concentration of Power and Wealth** - Long-term authoritarian rule led to economic inequality
4. **Catalyst Event** - Mohamed Bouazizi's self-immolation in Tunisia (Jasmine Revolution) became the direct trigger for the Arab Spring's spread across the Middle East

### Case Studies

- Achieved "rapid economic development" initially
- Despite increased higher education graduates, faced job shortages and economic capacity issues

**Outcome:**

- Power transferred to committee of senior military officers
- **Mohamed Morsi** (Muslim Brotherhood) elected as president

**Outcome:**
- Failed due to **El-Sisi regime's** (military dictatorship) seizure of power
